Python samples for the Google Assistant library
===============================================

This repository contains a reference sample for the ``google-assistant-library`` Python package_.

It demonstrates:
- Initialization of the Assistant
- Basic event handling including hotword detection.

.. _package: https://github.com/googlesamples/assistant-sdk-python/tree/master/google-assistant-library

Prerequisites
-------------

- `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ >= 2.7
- SBC with ``linux-arm7l`` (eg: Rasbperry Pi 3) or ``linux-x86-64`` architecture.
- An `Actions Console Project <https://console.actions.google.com/>`_
- A `Google account <https://myaccount.google.com/>`_

Setup
-----

- Install Python 3

  - Ubuntu/Debian GNU/Linux::

      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv

- Create a new virtual environment (recommended)::

    python3 -m venv env
    env/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    source env/bin/activate

Authorization
-------------

- Follow the steps to `configure the Actions Console project and the Google account <httpsb://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/library/python/embed/config-dev-project-and-account>`_.
- Follow the steps to `register a new device model and download the client secrets file <https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/library/python/embed/register-device>`_.
- Generate device credentials using ``google-oauthlib-tool``:

    pip install --upgrade google-auth-oauthlib[tool]
    google-oauthlib-tool --client-secrets path/to/client_secret_<client-id>.json --scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/assistant-sdk-prototype --save --headless

Run the sample
--------------

- Install the sample dependencies using pip_::

    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/
.. _GitHub releases page: https://github.com/googlesamples/assistant-sdk-python/releases

- Run the hotword sample. The sample waits for the "Ok Google" hotword, then records a voice query and plays back the Google Assistant's answer::

    python -m hotword --device_model_id 'my-model-identifier'

Troubleshooting
---------------

- If audio is not working, verify the ALSA setup::

    # Play a test sound
    speaker-test -t wav

    # Record and play back some audio using ALSA command-line tools
    arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=5 --rate=16000 --file-type=raw out.raw
    aplay --format=S16_LE --rate=16000 --file-type=raw out.raw
